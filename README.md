## Work Day Scheduler is a javascript-enabled quiz that was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

The Work Day Scheduler allows user to input tasks for each hour of the day. The scheduler can then save the input tasks in local storage to display when the user revisists the webpage. The color of the hour changes based on what time of day it is.

The webpage contains a jumbotron element showing the title and function of the Work Day Scheduler as well as the current date.

The color of the time is dynamically generated using Javascript functions leveraging the moment.js API.
